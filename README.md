## Objective

In this notebook, my objective is to develop a music generation model utilizing an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks). Through this assignment, I will gain the skills to apply LSTM to the task of music generation and create jazz music using deep learning techniques. The ultimate goal is to successfully generate original music compositions using the LSTM-based model. Moreover, I will explore the benefits of the Functional API in constructing complex models that cater to the specific requirements of music generation. By the end of this assignment, I will be able to produce my very own music compositions and even have the opportunity to listen to them, fostering a deeper appreciation for the creative potential of deep learning in the realm of music.
